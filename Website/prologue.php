Now, to start this story out, let me be clear. These events are as real to me (by me I mean the author) as any other memories I have. I don’t know how to classify this, I don’t know if It a mental condition or If I have just have some crazy ass imagination, but all of this is as if its another life in my head. The emotions felt, the pain, everything. And I must get this all out somewhere. It can’t stay cooped up inside my mind anymore. As a kid I used to do these things my mom and dad called “sound effects” which in reality was just me “physically expressing this world”. This consisted of me running around and flailing my arms and pewing and pahing. To my parents this might have seemed like I was being weird but through my very own eyes I could see. The fields of grass, the characters that talked to me the people I met. They existed to me. Just beyond some mystical realm I swore for as long as I can remember there’s more then meets the eye to this universe. Eventually as I got older and became more mature. Around the age of 8 I had an idea. Up till that point everything in my head was a mess, I called them pocket worlds nothing was the same across them some were set in space and others set in fantasy island. but one variable was constant. Me. So using this I fact I told myself that on the winter solstice of 2008 I would leave this world and join the one in my dreams. I don’t know if I wanted to die or not. Death has always scared me but that night was the night this entire thing began. I laid down in my bed. And closed my eyes and focused all my mental energy into one spot. I wanted to leave. Leave this world of blandness. This world of corruption and greed. Even at the age of 8 I was aware of the faults this world had to offer and I wanted to get away so bad. And. For a moment. I fell. The world around me washed away in a distinctly purple light and I fell. A beautiful voice spoke to me saying that I had to save her. and then just like that I was wrenched back into this twisted fucked up world. And I had tears on my face. Ever since then this piece of my brain has been permanently dedicated to an entire universe inside my head a uniform universe with all my ideals wishes and feelings all packed into this one world. Over the years this place evolved the people within and the places and time that passed all feeling so real. so so real. I thought that one day I would grow out of it. And it would disappear. But to this day (2018) none. Of. It. Has. Not a single person not a single event. Nothing has left my mind. The only issue is for me to “visit” this world I must express it physically. Like I did as a child. And this I have unfortunately grown out of. I can still see this world with my eyes but interacting with it takes so much energy now. And this is what worries me. If it takes actual physical energy to go there. To this eden what if in another 10 or 20 years will it all be in the past. Will I no longer be able to see it. Will this second life of mine be gone I told myself I never wanted to lose it I promised I would never let it die. And this. Me writing this is just me fulfilling my promise. I don’t want to let go of any of it and I need this all to be out in the open. I want people to know not just my story but the story of Hex. Something like a brother but closer to me. my other half. So that if his world dies at least he can live on in these very words. The text you are reading right now is the only life I can give to him in this world. And I’m going to be honest I’m not the best writer. And this is not the first time I’ve tried this, but I know this must be done. And if I’m still being honest I don’t even want to write this. I want it to be animated acted out. Drawn in a book. But I have none of those skills. But what I do have is this. The ability to read and write. And as primitive as it is these days. I’m going to write it all down. So that hex can forever exist in mankind’s greatest achievement. So here I go. This is hex’s LIFE from its beginning to its bitter end. In as much detail as I can muster up and throw into these words.
