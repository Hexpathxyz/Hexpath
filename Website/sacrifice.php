				<h2>Hexpath</h2>
			<p>   Hex’s eyes flutter open in the dim candle light from the corner of the room. “How late is it?” he thinks out loud. He gets out of the bed and walks over to the window. He peers out into the night sky lit with stars and a big bright moon. Down below is the same dusty brown plateau he awoke on, not a single tree or bush can be seen. “I wonder why it is so lifeless?” Hex turns around to a knocking at the door. “can I come in?” a small voice whispers, Hex goes to open the door to be greeted with the nurse that took his blood earlier. “don’t tell anyone I came here, but I just wanted to warn you that the ministry seems to be extremely interested in you and your origins” a worried expression fills Hex’s face “Why? Is this a bad thing?” the nurse sits herself down at the small table in the middle of the room. “Well the ministry isn’t exactly the nicest organization in the world. And throughout my life I’ve seen the evil things they have done to people in the past.” Hex sits down on the side of the bed “What is this ‘ministry’ anyways?” The nurse now dressed in a lavish statin bed robe begins twiddling her thumbs “Well they are like the high council representing the God of Ki, they govern all of Erova and have even more of a say then the king himself in everyday politics. They have been around for as long as anyone can remember, they monitor everything that has to do with Ki” The night sky in the background begins to break into a soft yellow glow. “Ki? What is this Ki stuff anyway” the yellow light begins to reflect off her soft face ever so slightly “well it’s a form of energy that all living things are born with, it flows through the circulatory system of your body, and in most people, there is about a liter of it at any given time, You humans over the course of history have learned to use it to manipulate the matter around us to your will” The Sunrise is now almost complete, and the entire room is lit with a soft bright yellow glow. “Wow that’s interesting. Can I use it?” Foot steps can be heard coming up the stairs, the door still being open allows General Hova to see right into the room, “ILISSA, what in the hell are you doing up here?!” The beautiful girl stands up to attention, “S-Sorry General” Hova points out the door “Be on your way Slave!” Hex shocked at how rude Hova was being exclaims “Slave? What do you mean Slave?” Ilissa leaves the room and pitters down the staircase quickly. “She is an Elvan Slave, we captured an Elvan Village Many years ago and have incorporated them into our ranks to utilize their special ability to use raw Ki. But they are still Elva and must be treated like so” Hex appalled by what he’s hearing gets up “She doesn’t even look different from us how can you assume she’s so Evil” Hova ignores Hex’s outburst. And begins to leave the room “Come with me, today is the day you begin your training, we don’t have much time till the invasion of the Elvan Homeland, and the ministry has put me in charge of your training” Hex and Hova continue down the stairs and many Hallways later they reach a Gigantic wooden door, Hova gestures to the guards to open the door, they heave on the some ropes and the door creaks open, on the other side is a large courtyard filled with armed men fighting with swords. And others throwing fire from a torch on the wall, Hex and Hova walk into the courtyard towards a stone shed. Hova Unlocks the shed, inside is a bunch of swords, spears, maces and such. “Here Take this” Hova passes Hex a short sword, she then unsheathes her own sword and they walk to an empty part of the yard. “For your first lesson I’m going to teach you how to use your Ki to ‘reinforce’ your body. Essentially you channel some of your Ki into your muscles and skin in order to increase your strength and your skins toughness. This is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself. If done properly, you can take hits from things like a massive ball of fire, and barely even feel the heat. But as a counter you will use up a little bit of Ki during this process so if you don’t run out of Ki you can tank even the hardest of blows. This is important because the Elva use a lot of powerful Ki based tactics and if you do not reinforce yourself you will be blown to bits in an instant.” Hex takes an awkward stance and readies his sword in front of him “okay how do I do this then?” Hova walks over and Touches Hex on the shoulder, he can feel himself stiffen a bit. “Try to replicate what I just did but, in your mind,” Hex closes his eyes and feels a powerful energy flowing through him, he focuses this energy outwards towards his skin. The ground around Hex begins to crack and Hex’s skin begins to emanate blue ever so slightly. Hova begins to back away “Uh Hex I think you should stop” Hex ignores Hova and continues infusing Ki, eventually he opens his eyes “I think I did it” a shocked expression can be seen on Hova’s face “My lord. I’ve never seen someone do it so perfectly on their first try. Your ability to control Ki is on the same level as an Elva.” Hex now curious to see what he can do readies his sword “lets spar!” Hova reluctantly enters a defensive stance, Hex swings his sword incredibly fast but amateurishly. His sword meets with Hova’s and blue sparks explode from the clash. He then brings his sword from the swing and slices from the right Hova expertly parries the attack and sends a slice towards hex’s left shoulder her attack lands and bounces right off his skin as if it were made of metal. Hex winces from the blow and goes for a stab at Hova’s stomach, his sword meets with her armor and shatters down the middle as if it was glass. Hex in awe chuckles “My sword broke” Hex looks up to meet Hova’s shocked expression, “Yes... I can see that. It must have been a poorly forged sword. Let’s move onto elemental training.” Hova walks down the snowy path towards the middle of the courtyard where she looks towards Hex, “I want you to do that same thing you did when infusing your Ki into your skin but instead focus that energy onto the stones around us” Hex still visibly enamored by his ability to shatter a iron sword focuses his attention onto a small stone sitting on the ground by his feet. The stone starts to shake and then slowly lifts of the ground, Hova yells “Now try reshape it into a cube!” Hex focuses more and more attention into the stone and it begins to slowly refine its shape into a very distinct cube, then small swirly markings begin forming on the cube, he then moves the cube towards himself and let’s fall into his hands “This is amazing!!” Hex exclaims as he holds the cube up and looks back to Hova who now has a horrified expression on her face “By the gods. What are you?” She backs away, Hex, confused says “What do you mean? I’m just good at this right?” Hova gestures the guards to leave the area, they do so promptly. Hova calmly explains to Hex “The fact you so quickly were able to not only lift that stone from the ground and reshape it on the your ‘first try’ was already astonishing, but then the fact you were able to etch a pattern into the stones surface itself, this is level of natural Ki control in humans is unheard of, I have no choice other than to tell you to stay within your barracks until the ministry can finish examining your data, Go now!” Hex surprised by Hova’s reaction runs back into the Barracks and up the stairs to his room, he closes the door and slides down to the ground and mutters to himself “I don’t understand what’s happening, who am I…? What am I?” Hex’s door slowly creeks open and Ilissa’s face peeps in” May I come in? she asks shyly” Hex smiles “Of course, close the door behind you this time though” She laughs as she walks in and closes the door behind her. Hex gets up from the ground to meet her eyes “So, What’s up?” He asks, she sits down on the edge of Hex’s bed and says, “I heard what happened from the other guards, and on top of that the ministry is sending a special forces unit here to apprehend you for further testing” Hex stumbles back and falls against the wall “What?! Why!? What did I do?” Ilissa smiles “you didn’t ‘do’ anything, it seems after analyzing your data they concluded you were neither Human, Elva or Dervan, you didn’t match anything in the database and your Ki levels are so high that they even pose a threat to the government. “Hex still in shock asks “What do I do? I don’t even understand what I am” Ilissa gets up and moves towards the window “I can take you away…if you want” Hex glances at her “What are you implying? We run away? We are in the middle of a highly fortified military base full of guys that can shoot fucking fireballs at will” Ilissa turns to face hex and opens her hands she holds them close to her face and closes her eyes and whispers into her hands, her eyes flutter back open as she holds her hands out towards Hex, a small light begins to form in the palm of her hands. This light grows in to a flame shaped like a small sparrow, the phoenix like sparrow opens its wings and flutters around the room, Ilissa opens the window and the sparrow darts out and explodes into a beautiful flowery pattern. Ilissa with a tear in her eye begins to talk. “What you did with the cube isn’t ‘unheard of’ the humans just can’t use there Ki like the Elva can. Or at least they won’t teach themselves to use it like the Elva.” Ilissa sits back down on Hex’s bed “They came to my home, in droves. Murdered my parents and slaughtered children. Hung them in the middle of the village, ‘to make an example of them’ they claimed if anyone else was to resist that they would meet the same fate, so we went with them they, marked us with seals and forced us to work for them. “Hex feeling light headed sits down beside her and puts his hand on her shoulder “where do we go then? How to we escape?” Ilissa smiles “we just run, let’s not think about the intricacies let’s just go, you are special hex I can feel it, maybe you can help me save my people from genocide, your window has a perfect view of the warp seal on the bridge. The one you arrived on. I can override its default connection and warp you just outside of the capitol from there just run north you’ll come upon the elvan army that is approaching the capitol as we speak. ” Hex asks “But what about you? You’re coming right?” Ilissa promises “Ill be right behind you” They both get up firm with resolve and move towards the open window, Ilissa steps onto the window still and leaps forward, her light red hair flowing beautifully in the wind as she gracefully hits the roof of the next building with a running start, Hex follows suit. As they run some nearby guards notice them running and scream “Hey! What are you two doing!” They ready their staffs and begin to fire beams of light at us, Ilissa yells in a foreign language “Eriftips!” small balls of fire begin to fly out of her mouth as she exhales, the balls grow in size as they gain speed and slam into the ground creating massive explosions Ilissa yells to Hex to keep running, eventually they make it to the warp seal and Hex jumps on top of it, Ilissa then slams her hands towards the ground and a runic pattern begins to grow to life around Hex, He feels something begin to pull him down and he yells for Ilissa to get onto the pedestal with him, in the distance a large platoon of guards In full armor begin running towards the gate Ilissa yells “Ilaberif Xinoehp!” as she throws her hands into the air, a large bird made of fire martializes above her and she throws her hands forward, as she does so the Phoenix flies like a bullet towards the guards and explodes sending a shockwave across the land the bridge begins to shake and collapse. Ilissa turns towards Hex with that bright smile as he fades away into a blue light.
She falls into the abyss below.
