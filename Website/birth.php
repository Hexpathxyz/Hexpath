			As a flash of purple light fades, Hex stumbles to his feet, The area around him very dark, there’s piles of ash with embers still aglow and large craters can be seen for miles. Hex looks up to see a light brown sky and the distinct smell of soot fills his nose “where am I” he mutters to himself as he looks down and examines his body. Slightly muscular build and very tall. He notices what seems to be a wall in the distance, its hard to see as the haze from the recent fire seems is clouding the distance, Hex begins to walk towards the wall as a horse and carriage passes him by, “ha-ha boy where are your clothes?” Hex looks down to only just now realize he’s naked, The traveler tosses some burlap pants and a rope “cover yourself up peasant” he whips the horses and begins onward. Hex decides to follow in his dust trail to eventually reach the cities gates, as he approaches the guards halt him “we can’t let foreigners into the capitol today, it’s the queens funeral please be on your way” Hex now even more confused questions him “where am I, what is this place” the other responds “you’re at the capitol of the humans homeland Erova now be on your way peasant there’s a small village to the east of here they should be able to help you more than we can” Hex turns to the direction he’s pointing and continues on ward. “damn its hot and I’m really thirsty, why the hell is the air so thick” eventually Hex comes to what seems to a outlet for the towns water source. “I might be able to sneak into the city from here” He jumps into the water it’s about as deep as his ankles, Hex notices the entrance is being blocked by a grate. But it’s so rusted that there’s many holes He could fit through. “Into the city I go”, as he’s walking he notices some light peering from above, A man hole cover presumably, Hex jumps up onto the ladder and climbs up, he lifts the cover to find he is on the other side of the wall, Hex climbs out of the hole and onto dry land to find himself in a damp alleyway beside a tavern. Hex begins to leave the alleyway and find himself amongst a crowd of people looking out onto an empty road, a little ways up the road Is a carriage, a man clothed in tight black clothing can be seen leading the entourage, as it approaches a black coffin with gold patterns laid across it can be seen, behind the carriage is a bunch of high ranking military officials along with an army of white armored men with tall scepters in hand, they all march in unison out of the main city gates. A small child pulls on Hex and asks as she wipes her tears away “why did the elva kill queen Ayeliana” Hex as confused as ever looks down and gives the little girl a hug “im not sure darling but I’m sure everything will be fine” Hex now determined to find answers enters the tavern behind him, its empty aside from the single bartender shining a glass he glances at hex and the continues to clean the glass. Hex walks up to the bar and asks “what happened to this queen of yours? Where am i?” the bartender shocked looks up “you do not know of what happened to our queen?” Hex replies “im not even sure where I am, I woke up in the middle that plateau of dirt and I can’t remember anything” the bartender smiles “ah a bit of amnesia from the battle, eh soldier” Hex now even more confused, looks at him “what do you mean I’m not a soldier at all!”  the bartender laughs “well you might not remember being one but the only people out there over the past 24 hours were the Elvaian army and the Erovan armed forces, and your clearly not an Elva so you must be human. Let me take you back to general Hova’s office and let medical take a look at you” The bartender takes his dagger belt from under the table and straps it onto his waist, he opens the side door. Hex follows the bartender through the streets as rain begins to trickle down from the sky “the names Cera by the way” says the bartender as he glances back at Hex “my names Hex” as he runs to meet his side “ah so you remember your name at least” Hex replied “Yeah I guess, it’s the first word that came to my mind when I woke up so that’s what I’ve been calling myself.” Eventually they reach a tall brick building attached the the walls of the city. We enter the building to be met with a fat man drinking at a registration desk, “Ive found a missing soldier from yesterday’s battle and I’m afraid he needs medical attention” Cere tells the man. The fat guard looks at me, “He don look like any soldier I’ve seen, lemma see your emblem” Hex looks at Cere and then back at the guard “I don’t have an emblem, I don’t even remember who I am” the guard chuckles “ahhaha okay then we could use more fodder for the upcoming attack on the Elva homeland let’s get you ‘reregistered’ and have a medical team take a look at you” The guard pulls out a piece of paper from filing cabinet beside him and writes down something illegible on it and places on a symbol on his desk, the symbol glows blue and the paper vanishes away. Hex shocked exclaims “WHAT THE FUCK, what did you just do” Hex staggers back into the bench behind him knocking over a table with some books on it in the process. “I sent your registration forms to the ministry so that they can reregister you into the Erovan network, damn boy you must have hit your head hard if you don’t even know what the Dervan system is ”Hex stumbles back to his feet “who are the Dervans? What system?” the symbol on his desk begins to glow again, and the paper reappears with more writing on it. “well it looks like you’ve been assigned as a level 1 foot soldier in division 13, lets get you to the military’s headquarters on Mount Elta” Hex asks “what? I have to go climb a mountain now?” the guard laughs at Hex again “No of course not the Dervan system will take us there, i’m sure the orientation will tell you all about it but for now let’s just get you over there” the fat guard opens the gate to let Hex behind the desk, Hex looks back at Cera “Thanks for your help ill pay you back later” Hex and the guard continue onward until they get to stone room with a heavy door on it, the guard unlocks the door and pushes it open, the Room inside is lit with torch light, and other then a stone pedestal in the middle it is devoid of anything else, the guard hands Hex his registration papers and tells Hex to stand in the middle of the pedestal, after so the guard places both his palms on the floor and the entire room is drawn to life with flowery patterns and runic symbols emanating from the pedestal. Hex begin to feel something pull him down as a pale blue light envelops his body, and just as Hex begins to panic he is absorbed into the ground as a glowing blue puddle and the room fades back down to the dim torch light. 
Hex panickily opens his eyes and gasps for air as he falls off a similar pedestal in the middle of a snowy path way. Hex gets up to be greeted by a female guard dressed In white armor, she greets Hex and tells him to follow her into the medical wing for examination, as they are walking Hex asks “uhm not to be a bother but how did I get here? What was that blue light” the guard looks back to Hex “that was Dervan teleportation, it’s a network of fractures in space-time that can be manipulated using Dervan Runes, ill let the orientation explain in more detail but first lets get you looked at.” They continue onward through many halls and corridors until they reach a large room filled with sick people and cots, a lady dressed in a pink dress runs up to Hex and the Soldier “General Hova! It’s so nice to see you again, who is this lovely young man?” she turns to Hex and winks, He smiles and blushes at her. “This is another solider we found from the battle with the Elva. He seems to have amnesia. We just want to see if there’s anything else wrong with him and what physical condition he’s in” the nurse smiles “sure thing boss!” she skips over to Hex and takes him by the hand “lets go cutie!” They walk over to a cot in the far corner of the medical hall. Hex takes a seat on the cot and the pink dressed nurse asks, “okay sweetie how old are ya?” Hex replies “uh I don’t know I thought we told you I cant remember anything but my name” she smiles “haha I know! I’m trying to jog your memory a bit” the nurse then takes a thin metal spike and a bowl “stick your hand out I’m going to draw a bit of blood for testing” Hex reluctantly stretches his hand out towards her she pokes hex’s wrist with the spike and a bit of blood dribbles into the bowl, She quickly places the bowl on the table beside her and then the holds her hand over Hex’s wrist, the nurse closes her eyes and a warm feeling envelops Hex as her hands glow with a blue aura. She removes her hands and Hex looks at his wrist to notice there’s no signs of a wound at all “Holy shit! how did you do that?” the nurse looks up from the paper work she began filling out. “silly! I just used my energy to heal you! It’s a talent ya’know!” she then takes the bowl from the desk and places it on her lap, she begins to hold her hands over the little bit of blood in the bottom of the bowl and it separates into all the basic elements that makes up blood. Eventually there’s nothing but a bit of water left in the bowl. “oh my! She exclaims. I’ve never seen anyone as untrained as you are having this much Ki in their blood. Not only that but examining your DNA its as if you were only just born not more than a day ago it’s so new and pure. no signs of aging what so ever. It’s like you have a newborns body but from the look you, you seem no younger then 19” Hex shocked asks “how is that possible. What do you mean” the nurse increasingly concerned with the data she has gathered flicks her fingers sending the papers away in a blue flame. “I must let the ministry examine this data. In the mean while let’s get you situated in orientation hall. The presentation is just about to start.” She gets up and ushers the guards over. General Hova comes over and tells Hex to follow her. They leave the medical hall and begin to walk down to the far end of the corridor, “it seems they found something interesting while examining you. Be sure to report back to the medical hall tomorrow for an updated response on your condition” Hex and Hova enter the meeting hall and take a seat amongst the other newbies. “The hold these once a day. Now more than ever do we have people enlisting in the Erovan armed forces. Ever since those wrenched Elva came out of there forest and began there conquest. ” Hex began to respond but a loud blaring voice began to speak from the center of the stage. “Welcome everybody! Today is the day you begin a new life! A new journey to ensure the peace and security of Erova forever more. During these dark times you are all needed now more than ever! And today I will show you all the basics you need to know to begin fighting the wrenched Elva right where it hurts!” an image begins to form on the wall behind him showing a map with a web of circles connected together across it. The announcer begins to speak again “this is the Dervan network. As many of you may know it’s a network of pieces of space-time that have been weakened to allow quick transfer between all these points you see. Together with the Dervan people we formed an alliance long ago to bring this very network into existence it consists of many complicated parts but together with humanity’s massive amount of natural Ki and the Dervan’s unique and very precise Ki control we have forged a network of points in space where with the help our Ki networkers can instantly warp between effortlessly” the image on the wall fades and is replaced with another, a office of people sitting at desks with there eyes closed. And hands glowing on there desks can be seen “this is one of the many offices where we created the Erovas largest market for jobs in history.  This is a Ki networking facility, here many worthy Erovans give out there excess Ki to power todays world, our army’s, Lights and the entire Dervan Network is held together day in and day out by these special people. Essentially anyone who joins this network has access to not just their own supply of Ki but an everlasting supply of Ki in order to finish tasks and fight, fights that would otherwise not be possible, this is our single greatest weapon we have in fighting the Elvaian Army. And as of today, you will all be given the ability to use this network at will for free. As part of the Erovan Armed Forces!” The crowd begins to cheer. And The announcer begins to speak again as the picture on the wall changes once more, this time to a forest of ginormous trees and a mystical pink border can be seen surrounding it “This is the Elva homeland. This is the place, that in two weeks’ time you will all see with your very own eyes as we launch the single largest attack on the Elva in history, to avenge our Queen! For Ayeliana!” the crowd begins to roar again as the announcer begins to walk back and the lights fade. Hex and General Hova get up to leave, “I’ll show you to the barracks where you can get some food and drink a bit, meet me at the medical hall tomorrow morning.” Hova points to a spiral staircase, there’s a free room at the very top you can use. Hex continues up the staircase to be met with a door, inside the room is a table with a plate of fruit and a leather wineskin is laying beside it, Hex eats the food quickly as if it was the first time he’s ever eaten and gulps the wine down. As the feeling of warmth that commonly comes with drinking envelops him he passes out on the bed to what seems like his first sleep.
